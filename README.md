# AutoSaveVim
## What's this?
A Vim plugin for auto-saving files on idle.
## Function
Changed files will be saved both in command and insert mode without typing `:w` explicitly.  
Default delay for saving is 1000ms.
```
set updatetime=1000
```
## Installation
(Under construction)
## TODO
- Hold a backup of an original file until the file is closed (done)
- Make commands to disable autosave temporarily
- Set file size limit to autosave
